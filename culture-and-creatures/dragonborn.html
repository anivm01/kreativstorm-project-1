        <h1>Dragonborn</h1>
        <p>
            In Celestia, Dragonborn are treated in a highly negative manner, viewed
            as little more than beasts and their intellect and sentience
            disregarded. They are often taken as slaves and treated as beasts of
            burden, with their natural abilities suppressed using magic suppressing
            collars. Dragonborn who are raised as slaves in Celestia tend to be
            uneducated and rough due to their harsh treatment, but they are by no
            means the dumb animals they are perceived to be.
        </p>
        <p>
            The discrimination against Dragonborn in Celestia is deeply ingrained in
            the societal norms and beliefs of the people. They are considered
            inferior and subjugated, with their abilities and potential ignored or
            suppressed. This mistreatment of Dragonborn is a result of the negative
            perception towards dragons, as Dragonborn are humanoid beings with
            draconic heritage. The fear and animosity towards dragons in Celestia
            have been extended to Dragonborn as well, despite their individuality
            and sentience.
