        <h1>Dragons</h1>
        <p>
            Dragons are considered inherently magical beings and are viewed as
            anathema within Celestia, regardless of their alignment. Even good or
            neutral dragons are not accepted in Celestian society. In fact, there is
            a practice among skilled warriors and adventurers of hunting dragons for
            trophies, as killing a dragon is seen as an immense feat of strength and
            bravery. This has resulted in the abandonment of Celestia by metallic
            dragons, who have chosen to stay away from a land where they are hunted.
        </p>
        <p>
            Chromatic dragons, on the other hand, may occasionally venture into the
            borders of Celestia, drawn by its riches and prosperity. However, their
            presence is not welcomed, and they are considered a threat to the peace
            and safety of the land. The people of Celestia view dragon hunting as a
            way to protect their land and rid it of these perceived threats,
            regardless of the dragon's alignment.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a result, dragons, even those of good or neutral alignment, are seen
            as dangerous and unwelcome in Celestia. The practice of hunting them for
            trophies has created a strained relationship between dragons and the
            inhabitants of Celestia. Metallic dragons have abandoned the land
            altogether, while chromatic dragons are viewed as threats and are dealt
            with accordingly by the skilled warriors and adventurers who seek to
            protect Celestia from their perceived dangers.
