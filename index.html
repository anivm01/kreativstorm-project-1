            <h2>A Brief description of Celestia</h2>
            <p>
                The country of Celestia is a deeply religious land, ruled by a powerful theocratic organization known as
                the Divine Council. The Divine Council is composed of devout followers who believe in the worship of a
                multitude of deities, each with their own area of influence and power. Their teachings shape every
                aspect of life in Celestia.
            </p>
            <p>
                The history of Celestia is marred by the destructive consequences of arcane magic. In the past, arcane
                practitioners became incredibly powerful, but their unchecked ambition and reckless pursuit of power led
                to devastating consequences. Their experiments often resulted in catastrophic events, causing widespread
                destruction and suffering throughout the land.
            </p>
            <p>
                In response to this crisis, the Divine Council was formed with the primary goal of restoring balance and
                protecting the innocent from the dangers of arcane magic. The Council, composed of representatives from
                the eight factions that follow the major deities, united their efforts to confront and subdue the
                reckless arcane practitioners. Through fierce battles and continuous persecution, the Council was able
                to overcome the arcane practitioners, either by defeating them in combat, imprisoning them, or banishing
                them from Celestia.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a result of this dark period in history, the Divine Council established a strict law prohibiting the
                practice of arcane magic in Celestia. This law serves as a safeguard to prevent the resurgence of
                reckless and destructive arcane practices, and to protect the citizens of Celestia from the devastating
                consequences of uncontrolled magic. The Council continues to uphold and enforce this law, ensuring that
                the citizens of Celestia are shielded from the risks and dangers associated with arcane magic, and that
                the realm remains safe and balanced.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite the Divine Council's strict rule, Celestia is a prosperous country, with a strong economy and a
                skilled workforce. The country's vast farmlands and rich mines provide ample resources for the people,
                and many skilled artisans and craftsmen call Celestia home.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, not all are content under the Divine Council's rule. Some see the religious order as oppressive
                and seek to overthrow them, while others simply wish for more personal freedoms. These dissenters often
                gather in secret, hoping to one day overthrow the Divine Council and create a more egalitarian society.
            </p>
            <p>
                As adventurers in Celestia, the players may find themselves caught up in the political intrigue of the
                Divine Council and its dissenters. They may be tasked with carrying out the Divine Council's will, which
                may involve rooting out practitioners of arcane magic or hunting down rebels. Alternatively, they may
                choose to join the resistance and fight against the religious order's persecution of arcane magic.
                Whatever path they choose, the players will find themselves in a land deeply shaped by religion, where
                faith and politics are deeply intertwined, and arcane magic is viewed with fear and suspicion.

                Divine Council Hierarchy: The Divine Council is not a monolithic entity, but rather a complex hierarchy
                of priests, clerics, and other devout followers. The highest-ranking members of the Divine Council are
                known as the "Elders," and they hold immense power and authority in the country. They are believed to be
                the direct conduits of the deities and serve as the ultimate decision-makers in matters of faith and
                governance. Below the Elders are various branches of the Divine Council, such as the Order of the
                Sanctum, the Keepers of the Sacred Texts, and the Inquisitors, each with its own responsibilities and
                influence.
            </p>
            <p>
                Religious Rites and Ceremonies: Religion plays a central role in the daily lives of Celestia's
                inhabitants, and the country is known for its elaborate religious rites and ceremonies. From grand
                processions and festivals that celebrate the different deities, to solemn rituals of purification and
                atonement, the people of Celestia are deeply committed to their faith. These religious practices are
                often closely regulated by the Divine Council, and participation is expected from all citizens.
            </p>
            <p>
                Role of the Church: The Church of Celestia, led by the Divine Council, not only has spiritual authority
                but also significant political and economic power. The Church oversees the allocation of resources,
                distribution of wealth, and administration of justice in the country. The Church's influence extends to
                every aspect of life in Celestia, and its teachings shape the moral code and societal norms of the
                country.
            </p>
            <p>
                Inquisitors and Enforcers: The Divine Council employs a group of elite enforcers known as the
                Inquisitors, who are charged with hunting down practitioners of arcane magic and maintaining the
                Council's authority. These highly trained and zealous individuals are feared and respected by the
                populace, as they wield immense power and authority to enforce the Council's laws. The Inquisitors are
                known for their relentless pursuit of heretics and their unwavering loyalty to the Divine Council.
                Inquisitors wear a White Lotus symbol to signify their “purity”
            </p>
            <p>
                Underground Resistance: Despite the Divine Council's oppressive rule, there are those who oppose their
                authority and seek to challenge the ban on arcane magic. The underground resistance, known as the Order
                of the Silver Star, operates in secret, helping practitioners of arcane magic evade capture and plotting
                to overthrow the Divine Council. The Order of the Silver Star is made up of a diverse group of
                individuals, including former members of the Church, disillusioned citizens, and rogue practitioners of
                magic.
