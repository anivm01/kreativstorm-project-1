        <h1>The Radiant Disciples</h1>
        <h2>Followers of Solara, The Lightbringer</h2>
        <p>
            The Radiant Disciples, followers of Solara, The Lightbringer, are known for their healing, purification, and
            enlightenment abilities. They provide counsel on matters of health, well-being, and spiritual guidance,
            promoting harmony and purity within the realm.
        </p>
        <p>
            They are meant to be a benevolent and altruistic group, dedicated to spreading the virtues of light, truth,
            and wisdom. The Radiant Disciples are skilled in the art of healing and purification, and they often serve
            as mentors and guides. They are also responsible for maintaining the spiritual purity of Celestia, ensuring
            that no darkness or corruption can penetrate its borders. Among them is a faction of anti-magic zealots who
            view anything arcane and impure and seek to “cleanse the world of the taint of arcane magic”.
