        <h1>The Divine Council</h1>
        <h2>The Circle of Elders</h2>
        <p>
            The Circle of Elders, comprising representatives from each of the eight factions that follow the major
            deities in Celestia, serves as the ruling body of the realm. The Circle convenes to make decisions on
            matters of governance, policy, and law, guided by the principles and teachings of the deities they
            represent. Each faction brings its unique perspectives, expertise, and influence to the Circle, contributing
            to the overall governance and wellbeing of Celestia.
        </p>
        <p>
            Together, the leaders of these eight factions form the Circle of Elders, bringing their unique expertise and
            perspectives
            to the table while upholding the beliefs and principles of their respective deities. The Council works in
            harmony to govern Celestia and ensure the welfare and prosperity of its people, upholding the prohibition on
            arcane magic while utilizing their diverse skills, knowledge, and abilities to maintain the balance and
            harmony of the realm.
