        <h1>The Soulbound</h1>
        <h2>Followers of Morwyn, the Reaper of Souls</h2>
        <p>
            The Soulbound, led by Morwyn, the Reaper of Souls, offer insights on matters related to the afterlife,
            death,
            and the souls of the departed. They provide guidance on matters of justice, punishment, and redemption, and
            ensure that the souls of the departed find their rightful place in the cycle of life and death.
        </p>
        <p>
            They are a solemn and introspective group, dedicated to understanding the mysteries of death and the
            afterlife. They are responsible for conducting funerary rites and ensuring that the souls of the deceased
            make their way safely to the underworld. The Soulbound are skilled in divination and the art of communing
            with spirits, and they often serve as advisors to rulers and leaders.
