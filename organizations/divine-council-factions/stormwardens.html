            The Stormwardens, followers of Raijin, the Stormbringer, are masters of weather manipulation, disaster
            mitigation, and agriculture. They advise on matters related to weather patterns, agriculture, and natural

            They are a proud and adventurous group, dedicated to harnessing the power of nature and the elements. The
            Stormwardens are skilled in the art of weather manipulation and elemental magic, and they often serve as
            explorers and scouts. They are also responsible for maintaining the weather patterns of Celestia, ensuring
            that crops grow and that the land remains fertile.
