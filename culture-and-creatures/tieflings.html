        <h1>Tieflings</h1>
        <p>
            In Celestia, tieflings are deeply hated and discriminated against. They
            are considered to be unclean and evil due to their perceived association
            with demonic influence, despite the fact that tieflings, like any other
            race, can have a wide range of alignments and moral values. This
            prejudice against tieflings is deeply ingrained in the society of
            Celestia, and tieflings often face widespread ostracism and persecution.
        </p>
        <p>
            In some parts of Celestia, tieflings are hunted just as fervently as
            arcane practitioners, due to the belief that they possess inherent
            malevolence and pose a threat to society. Tieflings are often
            scapegoated and blamed for any misfortune or calamity that occurs,
            regardless of their actual involvement. This has led to tieflings being
            marginalized and forced to live in fear and hiding, constantly on guard
            against prejudice and violence.
        </p>
        <p>
            Parents who give birth to tiefling children are often met with shame and
            stigma. Many choose to abandon their tiefling children, claiming that
            the child died during birth, in order to avoid the social repercussions
            and ostracism that having a tiefling child brings. Husbands have been
            known to leave their wives who give birth to tiefling children,
            believing them to be unclean and tainted by demonic influence.
        </p>
        <p>
            This systemic prejudice against tieflings in Celestia is deeply unjust
            and discriminatory, and it perpetuates a cycle of fear, hatred, and
            persecution against an entire race based on unfounded beliefs and
            stereotypes. Despite this harsh treatment, tieflings within Celestia
            often struggle to prove their worth and demonstrate their inherent
            goodness, fighting against the pervasive prejudice and striving for
            acceptance and equality in a society that views them with suspicion and
            fear.
